    "# Multiple Custom Grouping Aggregations\n",
    "\n",
    "This challenge is going to be fairly difficult, but should answer a question that many pandas users face - What is the best way to do a grouping operation that does many custom aggregations? In this context, a 'custom aggregation' is defined as one that is not directly available to use from pandas and one that you must write a custom function for. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Pandas Challenge 1, a single aggregation, which required a custom grouping function, was the desired result. In this challenge, you'll need to make several aggregations when grouping. There are a few different solutions to this problem, but depending on how you arrive at your solution, there could arise enormous performance differences. I am looking for a compact, readable solution with very good performance.\n",
